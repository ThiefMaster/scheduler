# scheduler

A simple tool to find days where everyone is available.

- No auth for now, this is meant to be used within trusted communities
- No i18n (and the UI is in German, because I wrote this to find dates to play
  D&D and some of the players prefer German)
- Super shitty "database" for now because this is still a prototype and I was
  too lazy to add a real DB
- And generally the whole thing is very much work-in-progress
